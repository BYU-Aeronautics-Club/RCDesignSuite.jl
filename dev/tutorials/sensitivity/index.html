We&#39;ll start at both and work our way toward the middle. At the output side of things, we&#39;ll pick some performance criteria.  In this case, let&#39;s go with the Mission Scoring Criteria from the 2020-2021 AIAA DBF Competition Rules:</p><p><strong>Flight Mission 1:</strong> Failure = 0, Success = 1</p><p><strong>Flight Mission 2:</strong> <span>$M2 = 1 + [N_{(\#containers/time)}/Max_{(\#containers/time)}]$</span> where <span>$Max_{(\#containers/time)}$</span> is the highest <span>$\#containers/time$</span> of all competing teams, and time is the time to complete 3 laps.</p><p><strong>Flight Mission 3:</strong> <span>$M3 = 2 + [N_{(\#laps \times sensor length \times sensor weight)} / Max_{(\#laps \times sensor length \times sensor weight)}]$</span> where <span>$Max_{(\#laps \times sensor length \times sensor weight)}$</span> is the highest <span>$\#laps \times sensor length \times sensor weight$</span> score of all competing teams.</p><p><strong>Ground Mission</strong> <span>$GM = [Min_{time} / N_{time}]$</span> where <span>$Min_{time}$</span> is the fastest time of all competing teams.</p><p><strong>Design Report</strong> Range from 0 to 100 based on rubric.</p><p>For the sake of our example here, we&#39;ll chose a few design variables (inputs) to which the design will  likely be sensitive.  These are:</p><ul><li>Weight, <span>$W$</span>,</li><li>Wing Area, <span>$S$</span>,</li><li>Zero Lift Drag Coefficient, <span>$C_{D_0}$</span>,</li><li>Available Battery Energy, <span>$eb$</span>,</li><li>Total Propulsive Efficiency, <span>$\eta$</span>, and</li><li>Available Thrust at Propeller, <span>$T$</span>.</li></ul><p>Noting some of the specific payload items in the Flight Mission scores, we&#39;ll also probably need to include</p><ul><li>the number of containers, <span>$ncon$</span>, and</li><li>sensor length times sensor weight, <span>$slxsw$</span>.</li></ul><p>Take note that we are <em>not</em> simply choosing the direct inputs to the scoring functions.  We want to calculate things like time and number of laps based on our design to see how the scores are sensitive to the <em>design</em> rather than the scoring function inputs.</p><h2 id="Do-I-have-to-include-all-the-inputs-and-outputs-in-my-study?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Do-I-have-to-include-all-the-inputs-and-outputs-in-my-study?">Do I have to include all the inputs and outputs in my study?</a><a id="Do-I-have-to-include-all-the-inputs-and-outputs-in-my-study?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Do-I-have-to-include-all-the-inputs-and-outputs-in-my-study?" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>For the purposes of this example sensitivity study, we&#39;ll assume success on the first flight mission, and we might as well assume a perfect score on the design report, but either way, these metrics are not sensitive to our design, so we exclude them.  We will also exclude the Ground Mission in this example since it is difficult to quantify <em>a priori</em> what the score might be, as physical testing is most likely needed.</p><p>That leaves us with Flight Missions 2 and 3 as our sensitivity metrics. That is to say, we are going to look at how changing our basic design variables affects the values for M2 and M3.</p><p>As for inputs, our choices are already very basic.  Each of these is comprised of more detailed variables. For example, the weight is a sum of all the component weights, the wing area is a function of span and chord, and the propulsive efficiency is a combination of battery, wire, ESC, motor, and propeller efficiencies.  For the sake of the sensitivity study, if a change in one of the detailed components yields the same change in output as another, then you should probably choose a more general input.  This is precisely why we chose the quantity sensor length times sensor weight rather than each of those separately.</p><div class="admonition is-success"><header class="admonition-header">Tip: How to know what to include</header><div class="admonition-body"><p>Another way to think about which inputs to include is to look at how they affect the derivative of the function.

In order to connect the inputs and the outputs, we need to create some sort of model.  To do so, we need to decide how simple or complex we want to be and what assumptions we are willing to make.  For the sake of this example, we are going to make some big assumptions and keep things quite simple.</p><h3 id="The-Objective-Function"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-Objective-Function">The Objective Function</a><a id="The-Objective-Function-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-Objective-Function" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>We&#39;re going to start with a function we&#39;ll call <code>objective</code>. Why? Mostly because how we have chosen to set things up in this example resembles an optimization problem, and that&#39;s a common name for this kind of function.  This is the function that takes in the basic inputs and outputs the overall &quot;objective,&quot; which is the sum of the mission scores in our case.</p><pre><code class="language-">function objective(design_variables)

    # Do some stuff

    return M2 + M3

end</code></pre><p>But what do we put in the middle?  How do we get from inputs to outputs?  There are a lot of options, but let&#39;s try the following:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">import RCDesignSuite; rcds = RCDesignSuite;

function objective(design_variables; return_all=false)

    ### STEP 1: UNPACK DESIGN VARIABLES ###
    # Here is where you unpack the relevant design variables.
    W               = design_variables[1] # Aircraft Weight
    S               = design_variables[2] # Wing Area

    T               = design_variables[6] # Available Thrust at Prop.
    ncon            = design_variables[7] # Number of Containers
    slxsw           = design_variables[8] # Length x weight of sensor
    # Normalization Factors are the last 2 inputs in this example
    M2_norm_factor  = design_variables[end-1] # Flight Mission 2 Normalization Factor
    M3_norm_factor  = design_variables[end] # Flight Mission 3 Normalization Factor



    ### STEP 2a: CALCULATE FLIGHT MISSION 2 SCORE ###
    # Here is where you set up the inputs for flight mission 2
    M2_inputs = design_variables[[1:3;6:7]]

    # Call the mission2() function here (to be defined below)
    M2 = mission2(M2_inputs, M2_norm_factor)


    ### STEP 2b: CALCUALATE FLIGHT MISSION 3 SCORE ###
    # Here is where you set up the inputs for flight mission 3
    M3_inputs = design_variables[[4;5;8]]

    # Call the mission3() function here (to be defined below)
    M3 = mission3(M3_inputs, M2_norm_factor)



    ### STEP 3: SUM UP OBJECTIVES ###

    # Sum them up
    totalpoints = M2 + M3

    # Return the outputs (sometimes we might want to see them individually)
    if return_all
        return totalpoints, M2, M3
    else
        return totalpoints

We&#39;re also going to use one of the functions found in RCDesignSuite.jl, namely, <code>maxvelocity()</code> to find the velocity and then calculate the time to complete the mission.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function mission2(M2_inputs, M2_norm_factor, lap_distance=3000)

    D = 1

All we need to do is to loop through each of the design variables and sweep them through a range of values, keeping all the rest constant, and then plot how the objective changes with the changes in the design variables.</p><p>But you&#39;re probably wondering where the norm_factor variables come into play, right? (Maybe not, it depends on how much you&#39;ve been paying attention.)  For this example, we&#39;re actually going to run through the whole loop twice.  The first time, we&#39;re going to save the maximum values of the individual scores and use those as the normalization factors.
