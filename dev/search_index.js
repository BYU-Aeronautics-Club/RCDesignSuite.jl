We will also exclude the Ground Mission in this example since it is difficult to quantify a priori what the score might be, as physical testing is most likely needed.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/sensitivity/","page":"Sensitivity Study","title":"Sensitivity Study","text":"That leaves us with Flight Missions 2 and 3 as our sensitivity metrics. That is to say, we are going to look at how changing our basic design variables affects the values for M2 and M3.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/sensitivity/","page":"Sensitivity Study","title":"Sensitivity Study","text":"As for inputs, our choices are already very basic.  Each of these is comprised of more detailed variables. For example, the weight is a sum of all the component weights, the wing area is a function of span and chord, and the propulsive efficiency is a combination of battery, wire, ESC, motor, and propeller efficiencies.  For the sake of the sensitivity study, if a change in one of the detailed components yields the same change in output as another, then you should probably choose a more general input.  This is precisely why we chose the quantity sensor length times sensor weight rather than each of those separately.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/sensitivity/","page":"Sensitivity Study","title":"Sensitivity Study","text":"tip: Tip\nAnother way to think about which inputs to include is to look at how they affect the derivative of the function.

In order to connect the inputs and the outputs, we need to create some sort of model.  To do so, we need to decide how simple or complex we want to be and what assumptions we are willing to make.  For the sake of this example, we are going to make some big assumptions and keep things quite simple.","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/#Theory","page":"Theory","title":"Theory","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"theory/","page":"Theory","title":"Theory","text":"theory here","category":"page"},{"location":"reference/#Reference","page":"API Reference","title":"Reference","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"reference/","page":"API Reference","title":"API Reference","text":"put all the functions and how to use them here","category":"page"},{"location":"#RCDesignSuite.jl","page":"Intro","title":"RCDesignSuite.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Intro","title":"Intro","text":"This is the documentation for RCDesignSuite.jl.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Intro","title":"Intro","text":"Note that the majority of the contents here were created by/for the BYU Aeronautics club, so some of the examples/tutorials are quite specific and are directed toward a freshman level club member.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/initialsizing/#Initial-Sizing","page":"Initial Sizing","title":"Initial Sizing","text":"","category":"section"}]
