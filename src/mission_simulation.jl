Functions for mission simulation

=#



##### ----- Take-off Model ----- #####
# calculate lift-off distance for flat runway

# perhaps put together acceleration model (see report for year with ramp takeoff that plotted takeoff trajectories)



##### ----- Climb Model ----- #####
# calculate climb distance and time



##### ----- Cruise Model ----- #####
# Calculate max speed, most efficient speed, etc.



##### ----- Turning Model ----- #####
# calculate loading for structural constraint

# calculate turn radius

# calculate altitude loss in turn if needed.


##### ----- Descent Model ----- #####
# Caclulate descent distance and time



##### ----- Landing Model ----- #####
# calculate landing distance



##### ----- V-n Diagram ----- #####
# Put together flight envelope for mission
